# Bleeding/Ischaemia Risk Trade-off Models
#
# This is a script about different approaches to assessing
# the potential changes in outcomes due to modifications in
# therapy based on a bleeding/ischaemia risk trade-off tool,
# under different probability models of the underlying outcomes.
#
# The purpose is to understand what effects could be expected,
# and what side-effects may occur in the ischaemia outcomes as
# a result of attempting to reduce bleeding risk.
#
# The underlying framework for these calculations is as follows:
#
# - Patients are divided into a group where the bleeding/ischaemia
#   risk tool is used (A) and one where it is not (B).
# - The overall goal is to reduce severe bleeding complications,
#   under the hypothesis that ischaemia outcomes are already quite
#   well managed. As a result, it is a success is the group A has
#   less bleeding outcomes than group B, without there being an
#   increase in ischaemia outcomes. (An alternative possibility
#   would be to allow an increase in ischaemia outcomes, provided
#   that it is less than the reduction in count of bleeding
#   outcomes.)
#
# The following prevalences of outcomes following ACS/PCI will
# be assumed (corresponding to group B):
#
# NI + NB: 92.2%
# I + NB: 6.6%
# NI + B: 1.0%
# I + B: 0.2%
#
# Success of the intervention used in group A is defined by
# a reduction in the rate of * + B outcomes, that comes with
# no increase in total I + * outcomes.

# DETERMINISTIC MODELS
#
# In the models below, it is assumed that the outcomes are deterministic
# in the group A, and the job of the prediction tool is to predict these
# outcomes so as to establish the group who will bleed, and apply an
# intervention to them.

# Model 0: Exact prediction of bleeding/ischaemia, intervention
# completely removes bleeding event (no effect on ischaemia)
#
# In this model, it is assumed that bleeding and ischaemia outcomes
# can be predicted exactly, and the intervention (modification of DAPT)
# is such that a bleeding outcome can be entirely (deterministically) removed
# without affecting the ischaemia outcome. No calculation is required to
# establish the outcomes under this model, because all * + B outcomes
# would be added to * + NB categories, resulting in:
#
p_a_ni_nb = p_b_ni_nb + p_b_ni_b
p_a_i_nb = p_b_i_nb + p_b_i_b

# Model 1: Exact prediction of bleeding/ischaemia, intervention has
# probability p to remove bleeding event (no effect on ischaemia)
#
# In this model, it is assumed that a patient who will bleed is
# identified deterministically, but the intervention will only
# remove the bleeding event with probability p. However, the
# ischaemia event will not be modified.
#

# Model 2: Exact prediction of bleeding/ischaemia, intervention has
# probability p to remove bleeding event, and probability p to add
# ischaemia event
#
# In this model, bleeding events will be removed with some
# probability, but there is the same probability that an
# ischaemia event is introduced. Since the prediction of original
# outcome is exact (and therefore the intervention is highly
# tailored), there is no effect on outcomes in the group who would
# not bleed (98%)
#
# Here, the decrease in bleeding outweighs the increase in ischaemia
# in whatever proportional split there is between ischaemia and
# non ischaemia in the bleeding group. For example, for a split of
# 50%, bleeding reduced by twice as much as ischaemia increases
# (because all the bleeding events are subject to p, but only half
# of the ischaemia events are, the other half already having an
# ischaemia event.

# be eliminated, and there is no possible adverse effect on ischaemia.
# Therefore, the proportion q of bleeding events will be eliminated,
# that is.

# intervention has probability p to remove bleeding event, and
# probability p to add ischaemia event

# intervention only based on the prediction of bleeding (whether
# or not the patient is predicted to have further ischaemia is
# ignored).
#
# Here, by getting the prediction of bleeding wrong a proportion of
# the time, approximately that same proportion of patients will
# incorrectly receive an intervention that increases the ischaemia
# risk. Since the pool of bleeding patients is so small, it doesn't
# take much for the total ischaemia increase to outweigh the bleeding
# decrease.
#
# This model motivates consideration of an intervention that depends
# on both the ischaemia and risk prediction:

# Model 5: Full Deterministic Model
#
# In this model, predictions are made for whether the patient will have bleeding
# or ischaemia events, which have probability of success q_b and q_i. Two
# possible intervention are made depending on the results of the prediction:
#
# NI/B: Intervention X, reduces bleeding risk by p_x and increase
#     ischaemia risk by p_x. The rationale is that the patient is at low
#     ischaemia risk, so a more aggressive intervention (such as lowering
#     DAPT) is possible to reduce bleeding risk
# I/B: Intervention Y, reduces bleeding risk by p_y (where p_y < p_x), and
#     does not modify ischaemia risk. This is a less aggressive intervention,
#     such as notifying relevant clinicians and the patient of the high bleeding
#     risk, but not modifying DAPT medication, so that the ischaemia risk is
#     not increased. Due to the less aggressive intervention, the probability
#     of removing the bleeding event is less compared to X.
# */NB: Do not intervene (depends only on bleeding prediction)
#
# To make the interventions more general, use the following notation:
#
# X: P(remove bleeding) = x_b, P(add ischaemia) = x_i
# Y: P(remove bleeding) = y_b, P(add ischaemia) = y_i
#
# Note that both X and Y can only reduce bleeding and increase ischaemia
# in this model. Note also that X and Y are mutually exclusive.
#
# Notethat splitting the interventions into X and Y in this model
# may be misleading, because those in the ideal Y group have a deterministic
# ischaemia event anyway, so there is no improvement due to the reduced
# intensity of Y. If the model included a model of patient risk which is
# modified by the interventions X and Y, then the reduced intensity of
# Y would be beneficial (this also matches reality better). Paradoxically,
# in this model, it is the people predicted to have no ischaemia which
# should be given the less intensive therapy -- this is just a defect
# of the model.
