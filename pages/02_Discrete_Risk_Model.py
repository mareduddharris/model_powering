# Calculate the result of making a risk estimate using the black box and then performing
# an intervention based on the result. The calculation is an average over the following
# possibilities:
#
# 1) A patient has some original (baseline) "true" risk category, according to the 
#    probabilities shown in the "Outcome 1" box. This defines the baseline absolute
#    outcome risks for the patient.
# 2) An estimate is made for this true baseline risk category using the black box.
#    The result is an "estimated" risk category, which is one of four possibilities.
#    This leads to performing an intervention if the category is estimated to be
#    LIR/HBR. For all other estimates, no intervention is applied.
# 3) The intervention makes one of four possible modifications to the outcome
